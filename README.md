# WAVtoDesmos
Quick project to represent wav files in Desmos as equations

## Requirements
- Parselmouth (`pip install praat-parselmouth`)

## Future Improvements Needed
An algorithm to condence pitches that stay constant to one equation out of the full piecewise equation would allow audio clips to be longer than 3-5 seconds without crashing the Desmos website
